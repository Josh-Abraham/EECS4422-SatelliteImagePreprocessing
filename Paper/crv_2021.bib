abstract = "A new image contrast enhancement technique, called histogram hyperbolization, is presented. It consists of a memoryless nonlinear, space-invariant transformation of the pixel brightness values. This transformation is based upon the histogram of the picture to be processed and the nature of human brightness perception. Examples show that this transformation yields images of increased intelligibility as compared to a similar and popular techniqne called histogram equalization. An application to spatial filtering is also presented and compared with homomorphic filtering."

abstract = {Vegetation often exists as patch in arid and semi-arid region. Numbers and areas and locations and spatial structure characteristics of vegetation patch are the important parameters for vegetation function and structure researches in landscape ecology. Visual interpretation of high spatial resolution remote sensing image to study landscape structure characters is often used, which needs lot of time and labours. In this paper, vegetation patches are detected using the canny edge detector and ellipticity measurement based on ALOS fusion image, and the whole processing steps were given. The detection accuracy of the patches is about 89.3\%, which is better than that of the methods that only used the spectral difference between vegetation patches and background. The experiments show that integration the canny edge detector with the algorithm for extracting circle and ellipse objects is simple and effective for detecting vegetation patches.}

    abstract="Deep Learning has pushed the limits of what was possible in the domain of Digital Image Processing. However, that is not to say that the traditional computer vision techniques which had been undergoing progressive development in years prior to the rise of DL have become obsolete. This paper will analyse the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. The aim of this paper is to promote a discussion on whether knowledge of classical computer vision techniques should be maintained. The paper will also explore how the two sides of computer vision can be combined. Several recent hybrid methodologies are reviewed which have demonstrated the ability to improve computer vision performance and to tackle problems not suited to Deep Learning. For example, combining traditional computer vision techniques with Deep Learning has been popular in emerging domains such as Panoramic Vision and 3D vision for which Deep Learning models have not yet been fully optimised.",
